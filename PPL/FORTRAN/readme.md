              Principles of Programming Language



Compiler Installation:  
	1. sudo apt-get update  
	2. sudo apt-get install gfortran  

Fortran Programming Guideline :  
	1. Write a FORTRAN program using some text editor  
	2. Open terminal and compile the source code  
		[Eg: gfortran hello.f90 -o hello]    
	3. Now execute the compiled program  
		[Eg: ./hello]    

Lab-1: Hello World  
	Task_1. Install FORTRAN Compiler  
	Task_2. A hello world program   
	Task_3. Take user input and disply (greet user)  
	
Lab-2: Primitive Data Structure  
	Task_1. Declear, define and use integer, real, double precision, logical and complex variables and constant   
	Task_2. WAP to find area of rectangle   
	Task_3. Select your own problem to work with premitive data structures  
	
Lab-3: Control Structure  
	Task_1. Get familiar with if, select case and do loop statement in FORTRAN  
	Task_2. A hello world program to read grade and display comment as per grade using if statement and select case   
	Task_3. Select your own problem to work with do loop statement in FORTRAN
	
Lab-4: Modular Programming  
	Task_1. Get familiar with different way of implementating modular programming   
	Task_2. WAP to implement subroutine, with and without arguments   
	Task_3. WAP to implement function, with and without arguments
